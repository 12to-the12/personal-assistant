# Inputs
- terminal repl
- singular query
- speech interface

# End Points
- keypress based session creation (requires daemon, whisper api call recommended to minimize resource usage)
- cli, text to text ( all this does is expose a user friendly GPT agent with access to system resources )
- speech to speech direct session ( original method, terminal shows what's being processes, speak to the machine, and be spoken to)
- unadorned chat mode, direct access to GPT agent
